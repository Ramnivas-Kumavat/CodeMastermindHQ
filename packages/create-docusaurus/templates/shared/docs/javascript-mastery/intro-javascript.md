# Introduction of JavaScript

## 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development.
It was originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995.
Since then, it has become an essential component of web development and is supported by all modern web browsers.

## 2. Setting up your development environment:

Before you can start writing JavaScript code, you'll need to set up your development environment.
You can use any code editor of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

## 3. Syntax and basic structure of JavaScript code

JavaScript code is typically embedded in HTML files using `<script>` tags. Here's an example:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My JavaScript Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <script>
      // JavaScript code goes here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

JavaScript code is made up of statements, which are executed in the order that they appear. Statements can be separated by semicolons (`;`) or newlines. Here's an example of a simple JavaScript statement:

```js
alert("Hello, World!");
```

This statement will display an alert dialog box with the message "Hello, World!" when the page loads.

## 4. Running JavaScript code in the browser console

Most modern web browsers include a JavaScript console, which can be accessed by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`. The console allows you to enter JavaScript code directly and see the results in real-time.

Here's an example of how to use the console to display the current date and time:

1. Open the console in your web browser.

2. Enter the following code:

   ```js
   console.log(new Date());
   ```

3. Press Enter. The current date and time should be displayed in the console.

## 5. Writing your first "Hello, World!" program

Now that you have your development environment set up and you understand the basics of JavaScript syntax, it's time to write your first "Hello, World!" program.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My JavaScript Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <script>
      alert("Hello, World!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code will display an alert dialog box with the message "Hello, World!" when the page loads.

Congratulations, you've written your first JavaScript program!
