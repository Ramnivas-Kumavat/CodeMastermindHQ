# Control Flow (Conditional Statements and Loops):

Conditional statements and loops are essential control flow mechanisms in JavaScript that allow you to make decisions and repeat blocks of code based on certain conditions. They enable you to create dynamic and interactive programs. Let's explore these concepts in detail:

### 1. Conditional Statements:
   - Conditional statements execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.
   - The most common conditional statement is the `if` statement, which executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
   
   ```javascript title="script.js"
   if (condition) {
     // Code to be executed if the condition is true
   }
   ```

   - The `if...else` statement allows for an alternative block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
   
   ```javascript title="script.js"
   if (condition) {
     // Code to be executed if the condition is true
   } else {
     // Code to be executed if the condition is false
   }
   ```

   - The `else if` statement can be used to check multiple conditions sequentially.
   
   ```javascript title="script.js"
   if (condition1) {
     // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
   } else if (condition2) {
     // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
   } else {
     // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
   }
   ```

### 2. Comparison Operators:
   - Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a Boolean result (`true` or `false`).
   - Common comparison operators include `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
   - The strict equality operator `===` checks for both value and type equality.

### 3. Logical Operators:
   - Logical operators combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean result.
   - The three logical operators in JavaScript are `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT).

### 4. Loops:
   - Loops allow you to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.
   - The `for` loop is commonly used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
   
   ```javascript title="script.js"
   for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
     // Code to be executed in each iteration
   }
   ```

   - The `while` loop repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true.
   
   ```javascript title="script.js"
   while (condition) {
     // Code to be executed while the condition is true
   }
   ```

   - The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop but guarantees that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.
   
   ```javascripttitle="script.js"
   do {
     // Code to be executed
   } while (condition);
   ```

   - The `break` statement allows you to exit a loop prematurely.
   - The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

### 5. Switch Statement:
   - The `switch` statement allows you to perform different actions based on different conditions.
   - It provides a more concise way to handle multiple conditions compared to `if...else` statements.

   ```javascript title="script.js"
   switch (expression) {
     case value1:
       // Code to be executed when expression matches value1
       break;
     case value2:
       // Code to be executed when expression matches value2
       break;
     default:
       // Code to be executed when expression doesn't match any case
   }
   ```
