JavaScript is a popular programming language used for web development, game development, and more.
To start developing JavaScript applications, you'll need to set up your development environment.
In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of setting up your development environment for JavaScript.

## Step 1: Install a Text Editor

The first step in setting up your development environment is to install a text editor. A text editor is a software application used to write and edit code. Some popular text editors for JavaScript include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.

For this tutorial, we'll be using Visual Studio Code. You can download it for free from the official website https://code.visualstudio.com/download. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions to install Visual Studio Code on your computer.

## Step 2: Install Node.js

The next step is to install Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It comes with a package manager called npm, which you'll use to install JavaScript packages and libraries.

To install Node.js, visit the official website https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the installer for your operating system. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions to install Node.js on your computer.

## Step 3: Create a Project Folder

Now that you have a text editor and Node.js installed, you're ready to create your first JavaScript project. Start by creating a project folder on your computer. This is where you'll store all the files for your project.

To create a project folder, open your file explorer and navigate to the location where you want to create the folder. Right-click and select "New Folder". Give the folder a name, such as "my-project".

## Step 4: Create a JavaScript File

Next, you'll create a JavaScript file in your project folder. This is where you'll write your JavaScript code.

Open Visual Studio Code and select "File" > "Open Folder". Navigate to your project folder and select "Open". This will open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.

To create a new JavaScript file, select "File" > "New File". Type in a name for your file, such as "index.js". This will create a new file with the ".js" extension.

## Step 5: Write Your First JavaScript Code

Now that you have a JavaScript file, you can start writing your first JavaScript code. Here's an example of a "Hello, World!" program in JavaScript:

```js title="index.js"
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Type this code into your `index.js` file. This code will print "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Step 6: Run Your JavaScript Code

To run your JavaScript code, open your terminal and navigate to your project folder. Type the following command:

```shell title="terminal"
node index.js
```

This will run your `index.js` file and output "Hello, World!" to the console.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your development environment for JavaScript and written your first JavaScript program.
